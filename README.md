# jRobot

An incredible jQuery Robot that animates fully. I do not typically work with jQuery, and wanted to find a tutorial, guide or 
something visually appealing that would motivate me to persist through any bugs that I find. Initially there was a lot of set up issues, understanding what files are needed to even 
work with javaScript and jQuery... This was interesting and there still are a few bugs but I have been making progress. 

I was able to get the individual images from the authors website in the source file. They are transparent PNG files and animating them was 
very interesting. Now that I have the index file properly displaying the images from the css files, I just need to work on tweaking the 
javaScript so it will be responsive and done.
