# jRobot

An incredible jQuery Robot that animates and rolls across the screen. I do not typically work with jQuery, and wanted to find a tutorial, guide or 
something visually appealing that would be different while also motivating me to persist through any bugs that I find. Initially there was a lot of set up issues, understanding what tags are needed to even 
work with javaScript and jQuery... This was interesting and there still are a few bugs but I have been making progress. JavaScript seems to have aspects of CSS and C# at the same time so it feels familiar while also being new. 

I was able to get the individual images from the authors website in the source file. They are transparent PNG files and animating them was 
very interesting. Now that I have the index file properly displaying the images from the css files, I just need to work on ensuring the javaScript issue is fixed. There are 3 javaScript files, one to animate the robot, one for jquery, and another to hold the custom functions.

Still having trouble with getting this to work. Going to take a step back tomorrow and go through the code in detail.
